It's time to see if you remember what I went through during the demo!

Please do the same as yesterday: cloning a repo, making a new branch of your name, and editing on that branch.

Afterwards, do essentially what I did during the demo: create a drivebase subsystem (only 1 motor is needed), create a command that accesses a method in the drivebase subsystem, and then assign a button binding
  for the command in RobotContainer. Then commit and push when done.

TODO: 
- Create a drivebase subsystem (1 motor) (done)
- Create a command that accesses a method in the drivebase subsystem (done)
- Assign a button binding for the command in RobotContainer (done)
- Commit and push
